Fonda Summer School, SÃ£o Miguel, July 2025 

Tutorial on remote sensing and Google Earth Engine (July 21, 2025)

Instructor: [Manuel Campagnolo ISA/ULisboa](https://www.cienciavitae.pt//en/7F18-3B3C-06BB)

Considering [assessment quiz results](Student_Assessment_Quiz.pdf) and time limitations, we'll focus on the following topics:
- accessing and processing data
- using Python API and geemap
- image preprocessing 
- temporal profiles
- combine satellite raster data with other geospatial data
- examples with NH3 datasets

Before the tutorial, please sign up for Google Earth Engine and create Google Cloud project at [Earth Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/earth-engine/welcome ).

The tutorial will be *hands-on* using either 
1. The GEE code editor (javascript). The [guideline](tutorial_v1.pdf) for the tutorial is a selection of pages from [https://developers.google.com/earth-engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) where one can find code descriptions and examples that illustrate topics like finding and filtering data (spatially, temporally and spectrally), visualizing images, creating charts, creating new images and bands, and exporting data.
2.  The Python API and [geemap](https://geemap.org/). Recommended tutorial [Earth Engine and Geemap Workshop at CVPR Conference 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us6MaBsL4cg)

2. [GEE community catalog](https://gee-community-catalog.org/)

Interesting links for geospatial:
- [OpenGeos](https://github.com/opengeos): geemap, GeoAI, ...
